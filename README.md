# Lean Canvas template for Obsidian
*Lean Canvas template for Obsidian and Obsidian Kanban*

Lean canvas by [Ash Maurya](https://blog.leanstack.com/what-is-the-right-fill-order-for-a-lean-canvas/) ready to use in Obsidian.

## Requirements

You'll need the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) app, with [Obsidian Kanban Plugin](https://publish.obsidian.md/kanban/Obsidian+Kanban+Plugin) by [Matthew Meyers](https://github.com/mgmeyers) installed.

After downloading the *lean canvas* folder from GitHub, pick the "open folder as vault" option in Obsidian.

You can then start filling your canvas.
